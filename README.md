# Epidemic Modeling for Everyone

![Multipopulation model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataForScience/Epidemiology101/master/SEIIRD_model_season.png)

Repository to accompany the blog series: __Epidemic Modeling__

These blog posts were recently featured in the [Data Exchange Podcast](https://thedataexchange.media/) by [Ben Lorica](https://twitter.com/bigdata) in two episodes: 

- [Computational Models and Simulations of Epidemic Infectious Diseases](https://thedataexchange.media/computational-models-and-simulations-of-epidemic-infectious-diseases/)
	
- [Assessing Models and Simulations of Epidemic Infectious Diseases](https://thedataexchange.media/assessing-models-and-simulations-of-epidemic-infectious-diseases/)
